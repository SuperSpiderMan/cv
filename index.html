        <p>Portfolio Manager at <em><a href="https://www.pecutilities.co.za/">PEC Utility Managment</a></em></p>
        <p>I studied electrical engineering and planned on following that line of
          work, however a job opening presented itself in the form of a portfolio
          manager at a utility management company called UMFA. After taking up the
          job I soon learnt to love it and the industry as a whole seemed to make
          sense to me where others seemed to strugle, this ease of understanding
          just snowballed my love for this new found line of work. Fastforward a
          couple years and you will find me working for a compettitor company,
          PEC Utility Managment.</p></td>
